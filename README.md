# starter-lab-4

Ensure your lab4.s on github includes the changes you made when implementing binary_search or you will lose marks!

Ensure your repository includes a CONTRIBUTIONS.txt file if you work with a partner and an AI.txt file if you use 
any AI tools.  These files should include the information outline in the lab academic integrity policy.
